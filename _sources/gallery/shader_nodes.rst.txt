Shader Nodes
=================

.. important::

    The difference between material tree and shader tree:

    - The marks of the decorated function in docstring are different: ``@material`` and ``@shader`` respectively.

    - A shader tree can be embeded in another shader tree or material tree, but material tree cannot.

    - A material tree can be assigned to an object.
